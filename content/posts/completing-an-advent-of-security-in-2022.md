It is the end of the year and I decided to complete an Advent of Security. Following the idea of the (Advent Of Code)[https://adventofcode.com/2022/about], I intend to complete every day an action that improves my digital security and privacy on the Internet.

The advent of Security is an Advent calendar of small actions that improve security and privacy in our digital lives. The intent is for people to use them as a guided way to reflect on and review their digital security setup.

I will be sharing the actions I will be completing this year in case you want to follow me on this journey. The actions will be easy to follow and complete by anyone with basic digital skills.

Let's do it.

## Day 1 - Install a password manager

Let's start with the basics. You probably use dozens of digital services and apps. If you are like me, remembering the password of each of them is mission impossible. Using the same password is not an option either. So, the action for day 1 is to install a password manager if you donÂ´t already use one.

If you already have one like me, the action for us is to improve how we use it by:

-   Making sure that the service we are using allows us to access it from multiple devices. We don't want to lose all our most important digital assets, passwords and credentials if we lost the only device where they are stored.
-   If you use the same password manager for life & work, make sure you store your work passwords in a (different folder or vault)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8esgZ7Kyrg].
-   Review the password of the service making sure is secure by 2022 password standards. Remember, this password is the gate to all your identities on the Internet.

I use (1Password)[https://1password.com/] and I am very happy with it. But there are other (free options out there)[https://cybernews.com/best-password-managers/free-password-managers/].

## Day 2 - Install a multifactor authentication app (MFA)

A password manager is the first step towards a better digital experience. But if we want peace of mind, we should use a multi-factor authentication service. So, action for the day 2 of this advent calendar is to install one on your smartphone.

If you already use an MFA service like me, the action for us is to improve how we use it by:

-   Making sure we can access the MFA services from at least two additional devices. This ensures that if we lose our phones, we can still access accounts with MFA enabled.
-   If the MFA service uses a backup password or code for recovery, let's ensure we store it in a secure place and, of course, we remember where.
-   Let's perform a security drill and leave our phones in another room and go to our sofa with our laptops. First, let's open an incognito window. Second, let's check if we can still access the digital services where MFA is enabled. Did you have to leave your sofa and go to the other room to grab your phone?

## Day 3 - Make sure to enable automatic updates on our digital devices

This is a simple one but is easy to forget. Make sure your devices (smartphone, tablet, laptop, smart TV...) have automatic updates enabled. Automatic updates will ensure potential security patches are installed as soon as they are made available. Here is a typical checklist:

-   Enable automatic operating system updates on MacOS, Windows, Linux, Android, and iOS.
-   Enable automatic application updates in your desktop, tablet, and Android app stores.
-   For the advanced users, make sure your OS package manager (e.g. brew in mac) has the option to (automatically update packages enabled)[https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-autoupdate].

## Day 4 - Review our browser extensions

Browser extensions like ad-blockers improve our digital experience while browsing the web. But they are also a potential attack vector that can compromise our privacy.

-   Make sure you reduce the number of browser extensions to the minimum. For each extension, ask yourself if you use it often enough that it deserves to clutter and slow down the browser. If the answer is no, just installed it every time you need it.
-   Once you get down to the minimum viable extensions, make sure they are up to date and come from trusted sources. I usually look at things like the number of reviews, and installations, if it is featured by the browser company...

## Day 5 - Create a list of our key digital assets

On day 5 we are going to create a list with our key digital assets. A key digital asset is something that if it gets compromised we will be panicking and running around with our hands in our heads. So, in a nutshell, assets that are worth taking extra care of. Here are mine. I divide them into two categories:

Physical:

-   Work laptop
-   Personal laptop
-   Smartphone
-   Portable SSD with personal documents

Digital:

-   Password manager service
-   MFA or second-factor authentication service
-   Personal email accounts
    -   I bet that we don't want anyone to be able to access the thousands of personal emails you forgot to delete over the years.
-   Work email account
-   Cloud file storage services like GDrive, OneDrive, and iCloud
-   Social accounts like Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter...
    -   I bet we don't want anyone to hijack our digital identity
-   Other important online accounts like bank accounts, Github, etc...

## Day 6
