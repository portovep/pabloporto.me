Nine years ago I moved from Dublin to Manchester to start my journey as a junior software engineer. Over the years I had the pleasure to work and learn from excellent software engineers and other people working in tech. I am very grateful for all the lessons I learned from them.

To mark my ninth work anniversary, I sat down with a nice cup of barista coffee and **gather my thoughts on what were the most important lessons I learned along the way**.

The result is a list of the advice I would give to a junior software engineer starting their career in 2023.

## 1. Optimize for learning

> Not all experience is created equal

Early on your professional journey prioritize learning opportunities over money or convenience. Learning and growing in your job is far more important than money.

**Not all experience is created equal. Doesn't matter how many years of experience you have. What matters is what you were doing all those years and with whom.** Treat being in the right learning environment as a priority for your first couple of jobs.

The best career decision I made by far was moving out of my home country and getting a job abroad. Being around passionate people that care about their craft pushed me to learn new practices and discover new technologies that I wouldn't know about otherwise. With remote working, people don't have to leave their places anymore, they can join this type of high-growth environment from anywhere.

Don't forget to study and train a bit each day. That daily hour of study will compound fast over the first years. Invest early in understanding how you best learn and find ways to apply what you learn at work. What works for me is reading articles and books and trying to apply new technologies and tools to the problems I am trying to solve at work.

## 2. Be a pleasure to work with

> The degree to which other people want to work with you is a direct indication of how successful you’ll be in your career as an engineer. Be the engineer that everyone wants to work with. - John Allspaw

Invest in learning the principles and practices behind modern software engineering. **Tools and technologies come and go, the principles and practices of our craft last longer**.

I was lucky to be in an environment where my colleagues emphasized the importance of good practices over tools. Knowing practices like clean code, refactoring, automated testing, and test-driven development will make your code a pleasure to work with.

Don't forget the other part though. Try not to become the engineer that nobody wants to work with. Collaborate with others, give a hand to that colleague that is stuck, listen to other people's ideas even if they are not your own, and try "be the kind of person everybody wants to be in a team with".

## 3. Strike a balance

> You cannot be really first rate at your work if your work is all you are. – Anna Quindlen

Find balance in what you do. **Investing additional time early in your career, like that extra hour studying every day I mentioned, doesn't mean that you should forget other areas of your life** like your health and relationships.

To avoid burning down, you should balance times where you invest more in your career and others where you can just relax and do your 9 to 5 shift. Try to get a good pace for a long and fulfilling career.

## 4. Boost your growth with feedback

> We all need people who will give us feedback. That’s how we improve. - Bill Gates

Constantly ask for feedback. **Feedback, especially constructive, will help you identify your blind spots and get to know yourself better. Feedback will boost your growth more than any other thing.** Over time, you will collect enough feedback that you will be able to see patterns and understand yourself better.

I am lucky enough to work for a company with an established feedback culture. I treat feedback as a treasure. I consolidate and curate the feedback I received in a commonplace. This allows me to spot trends, reflect, and write down some actions I want to take to keep becoming a better professional. I have a reminder every month to go over this list of trends and actions and assess if I am making progress.

If you are not asking for feedback, start now! Here are [good tips to get started](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-es/insights/blog/feed-feedback).

## 5. Become well-rounded

> To be a successful professional these days, I believe that one should go broad first (master the 20% that will allow you to deliver 80% of the tasks) and go in-depth only when there is a big need, a big opportunity, or a strong interest in keeping developing your skills further in a particular area. - Thiago Ghisi

Learn about product management, agile and lean processes, and the business domain of the problem you are trying to solve. It will help you become a well-rounded engineer. Be a product engineer and [question what you are helping to build](https://www.svpg.com/the-most-important-thing/).

Try to learn and get experience in different areas: delivery, operations, frontend, backend, etc. This kind of rounded experience will make you a better professional or what is called a well-rounded engineer. I consider being a [generalizing specialist](https://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/generalizingSpecialists.htm) the second best strength after learning how to learn.

**My best learning experiences came from leaving my comfort zone and pushing myself to wear other hats.** The better you understand the other roles in a team, the better you will be able to collaborate with them and contribute on building a high-performing team.

You can achieve this by volunteering to do the exploratory testing of a new piece of work, work with the operations team to build observability into your service, or fix and improve that broken continuous delivery pipeline. There are always opportunities to explore and cross the frontiers of your current role.

This can be controversial advice, but I believe the best engineers I worked with were well-rounded. They understood the end-to-end software development process and the product they were trying to build. They were not afraid to speak up and suggest improvements in areas not related with their main rol.

## 6. Share your journey

> Become a documentarian of what you do. - Austin Kleon

My biggest regret is not starting to document and share what I learned earlier. Don't become the engineer who only consumes, contribute back. Write that comment or appreciation in an article you like, post that article that you were thinking of writing for a year, and sign up for that talk you are too afraid to give. There is always someone that can find your current challenges and ideas useful.

Writing your ideas and learnings down and sharing them with people has multiple benefits. You get feedback from a bigger group of people, you can look back and check what was interesting or challenging for you five years ago, and you will improve your understanding of a topic.

**Don't do like me, build a habit to document, curate, and [share your work](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/) early in your journey.**.

## Conclusion

I enjoyed reflecting on my journey so far. I hope these tips will help you to create a long and fulfilling career as a software engineer.
