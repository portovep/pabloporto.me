The book Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps introduced the concept of the [four key metrics](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance) for measuring the software delivery performance of technology organizations. Since then, many software development teams have used them as a north star to understand if they are improving their software delivery capability. As a software engineer myself, I have used them in several projects to analyze potential areas of improvement.

## Motivation

I started to learn more about personal finances over the last few years. I like to apply a lean mindset to managing my finances. I don't enjoy spending hours tracking expenses and money in and out of my accounts. I want to have a system that gives me a high-level view of my financial health and performance.

During the last year, I started asking myself if I could apply the concept of the 4 key metrics to several areas of my life, including finance. What would be the 4 key metrics for measuring the performance of my personal finances?

My long-term goal is to create a system that allows me to achieve [financial freedom](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/112015/these-10-habits-will-help-you-reach-financial-freedom.asp). This term could have several meanings. Freedom means different things to different people. In my case, I understand financial freedom as a state where money doesn't condition my lifestyle decisions. That doesn't necessarily mean that I would like to stop working and retire to an isolated island.

## The selection criteria

I started by reflecting on all the things I learned about personal finances over the years. Mostly focusing on things people always give importance to, like paying off your debt, trying to save every month, etc.

I already had a tracking system in place based on a spreadsheet. I went through the metrics I was tracking and I started prioritizing them based on their impact on my long-term financial goals. I also differentiated the ones that are within my control, e.g. spending, from the ones that are not, for example, investment returns. It is not useful to track things that you cannot influence.

## The metrics

After this process, I arrived at the following 4 metrics that I consider key to understanding my financial health:

-   **Average Monthly Saving Rate**: Percentage of my total monthly income that I manage to save. Average over the last 12 months.
-   **Average Monthly Investment Rate**: Percentage of the total monthly income that I inveast, e.g. index funds. Average over the last 12 months.
-   **Total Debt**: Amount of money I owned if any. In general, prioritizing paying off debts above investing is a good idea. Although there are cases where the opposite is true.
-   **Emergency Fund Runway**: Number of months with covered basic lifestyle expenses. In other words, how many months I could live out of my saved and easily accessible money? My goal is to have a runaway of 6 months or more.

I believe all of these metrics are great leading indicators of how I am doing financially. If we take the categorization from the original 4 key metrics by DORA as a reference, we could also split the metrics into two main categories:

-   **Financial performance**: Help you to understand if you are improving the chances to increase your total wealth over time. By increasing your saving and investment rates you increase the likelihood of becoming wealthier over time.
-   **Financial stability**: Help you to understand how financially resilient you are if something unexpected happens. For example, if you lose your job. Having several months of runway in your emergency fund and no debt to repay will allow you to overcome financial challenges without worry.

> These metrics work for me and my current situation. They may not work for everybody. I encourage you to take them only as a reference.

## Next steps

I already started to see positive results by tracking these metrics. They help me reflect on my finances every month and make adjustments if needed. They give me a lean way to manage my wealth.

I currently review my finances and update the data needed to calculate them monthly. Similar to what we do in software teams, I would like to start automating the process of gathering the data to calculate these metrics automatically. I have a few ideas on how to do it. I may try to cover some of them in a future post.

And you, do you agree with these metrics? What are the financial metrics you track? Feel free to reach out by email or on Twitter. I am always willing to learn more about this topic and improve my current system.
