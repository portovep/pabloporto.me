I worked as technical lead in a data engineering team in charge of building an analytics data product. The solution generates insights on usage KPIs for a diabetes management platform. Some of the tasks I helped with:

- Build ETL data pipelines with Spark/Scala/AWS EMR.
- Build ELT data transformations with dbt/SQL in AWS Redshift.
- Adopt Redshift Spectrum and materialized views to optimize performance.
- Support the growth and impact of team members via 1-1s.
- Manage relationships with other teams and key stakeholders.
- Work with the data architect to modernise client's data ingestion architecture.
- Work with data analysts to optimise the data model for an embedded business intelligence dashboard in Tableau.
- Support the operations team responsible for data quality, data observability and reliability. Ensuring incidents and outages were mitigated appropriately.
- Define and lead a proof of concept to assess the technical feasibility of providing an embedded analytics solution to the end-users of the platform.
- Managing and prioritising technical debt.
- Generate synthetic test data with ScalaCheck.
- Foster a continuous learning environment by establishing sessions where team members can share what they learned.
