I worked as a technical lead for a data engineering team in charge of building a data product. The solution generates insights about usage KPIs of a healthcare platform. Some of the tasks I helped with:

-   Build ETL data pipelines with Spark/Scala/AWS EMR.
-   Build ELT data transformations with dbt/SQL in AWS Redshift.
-   Adopt Redshift Spectrum and materialized views to optimize performance.
-   Support the growth and impact of team members via 1-1s.
-   Manage relationships with other teams and key stakeholders.
-   Work with the data architect to modernise client's data ingestion architecture.
-   Work with data analysts to evolve the data model for an embedded BI dashboard in Tableau.
-   Support the operations team responsible for data quality, data monitoring, and pipeline health. Ensuring incidents and outages are mitigated appropriately.
-   Be the team's point of contact and lead for a proof of concept to assess the technical feasibility of providing an embedded analytics solution to end-users.
-   Managing and visualizing technical debt.
-   Generate synthetic test data with ScalaCheck.
-   Foster a continuous learning environment by establishing sessions where team members can share what they learned.
