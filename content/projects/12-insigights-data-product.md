I worked as a technical lead for a data engineer team in charge of building a data product. The data product provides insights about several usage KPIs of a healthcare platform. Some of the tasks I performed:

-   Build an ETL data pipeline with Spark/Scala.
-   Develop ELT health data transformations with dbt in AWS Redshift.
-   Optimising the performance of the data processing by leveraging Redshift Spectrum and materialized views.
-   Work with client's data architect to design the next generation of their data ingestion architecture.
-   Improve the reliability and observability of the data pipeline.
-   Work with the head of big data to tailor requirements and evolve the architecture of the solution.
-   Work with data analysts evolving the data model to build an embedded BI dashboard with Tableau.
-   Help the team supporting the operations team responsible for data quality, data monitoring, and pipeline health. Ensuring incidents and outages are mitigated appropriately.
