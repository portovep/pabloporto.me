I worked as an infrastructure engineer to build an internal engineering platform on top of AWS for a big company in the UK. The platform enabled delivery teams to leverage cloud-native features so they could focus on building secure and reliable applications in the cloud more quickly and cost-effectively. I helped with:

-   Bringing solid software engineering mindset and practices to the team.
-   Building a centralised monitoring and alerting solution to enable SRE teams to support live services.
-   Promoting and helping the team adopt infrastructure as code and Terraform best practices.
-   Deploying a scalable and reliable proxy solution based on SQUID using Terraform/Packer/Puppet.
-   Defining and implementing SLI/SLO for several services offered by the platform.
