I was assigned as an infrastructure engineer to help build an internal platform on top of AWS for a big company in the UK to help projects leverage cloud-native features, enabling product teams across the company to focus on building secure, reliable applications in the cloud more quickly and cost-effectively. Pablo contributed by:

-   Bringing solid software engineering mindset and practices to the team.
-   Helping building a centralised monitoring and alerting solution to enable NOC/SRE teams to support live services.
-   Promoting and helping the team adopt infrastructure as code and Terraform best practices.
-   Deploy a scalable and reliable proxy solution based on SQUID proxy using Terraform/Packer/Puppet.
-   Helping to define and implement SLI/SLO for several services offered by the platform.
