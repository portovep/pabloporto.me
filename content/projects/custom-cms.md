I was assigned as a full-stack developer to deliver and operate a custom content management system for thoughtworks.com. The CMS, built with a Ruby/Sinatra/Javascript stack, enables content managers and editors from different business areas (marketing, recruitment, sales) to easily inline edit, create and publish heterogeneous content using the same user interface as the company’s website. Other tasks:

-   Improving ThoughtWorks digital presence by implementing mobile-first designs and by empowering editors to create content through rich user interactions (JavaScript, SASS).

-   Integrating third-party services to the platform by consuming external RESTful APIs.

-   Keeping the project automated test suite healthy by implementing unit, integration, functional, and end-to-end automated tests.

-   Managing the project’s cloud infrastructure by automating deployment tasks (Rake, Fabric) and improving configuration management (Puppet, Packer).

-   Enabling continuous delivery by supporting and managing monitoring (collectd and Graphite), logging (logstash and Kibana), and CI/CD tools (GoCD).

-   Improving provisioning, deployment and build scripts to enable migration from snowflake servers to phoenix servers.

-   Adopt Docker to easily build local development environments.
