I worked as a platform engineer to build a secure site-to-site VPN on the cloud between two big organizations in the UK. The VPN provides a mechanism for these organizations to exchange PII information securely. In my role, I contributed to bringing the platform into production by:

-   Automating the configuration of an off-the-shell VPN product (Sophos UTM) using Python/Pytest. Orchestrating this configuration using Gitlab CI/CD.
-   Helping train and coach team members on how to do infrastructure as code following continuous delivery practices.
-   Provide a stable solution by implementing automated test for the Sophos UTM configuration using Pytest.
-   Helping with communications with a external team through different connectivity testing phases to ensure smooth integration.
-   Implementing and deploying public key infrastructure with client certificates to comply with security requirements.
