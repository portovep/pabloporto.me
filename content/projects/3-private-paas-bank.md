I worked as a platform engineer to build a custom PaaS solution for one of the biggest banks in Spain. The PaaS was built using Openshift/Kubernetes and deployed on top of AWS first and then in OpenStack. The goals were to minimize the time to market for the different digital services the bank offers, reduce costs and improve the developer experience. In my role, I contributed to the platform by:

-   Deploying a scalable and reliable Openshift/Kubernetes cluster in AWS using Terraform, Ansible, and ConcourseCI.
-   Designing and implementing multi-region and multi-AZ network topologies in AWS to meet scalability and resilience requirements.
-   Deploying a scalable and reliable Openshift/Kubernetes cluster in OpenStack using Terraform, Ansible, and ConcourseCI.
-   Automation of deployment, infrastructure testing (serverspec), and pipelines as code tasks using Rake and Ruby.
-   Helping with the design and implementation of a continuous delivery pipeline for infrastructure changes using ConcourseCI.
-   Advocating for DevOps principles and practices across product and platform teams.
