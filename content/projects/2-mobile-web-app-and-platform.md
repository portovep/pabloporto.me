I worked as a full-stack developer to deliver a custom mobile web application for a big wholesale retailer. The system was based on a React/Redux stack for the front-end and Spring/Java/Cassandra for the back-end. It helps drivers with the process of delivering goods to customers. Other tasks:

-   Work closely with the client to define the user experience of the MVP.
-   Implement a mobile-first and responsive UI for the MVP using HTML5 and SASS.
-   Lead, plan and automate the deployment of the whole system into a Kubernetes cluster using Google Container Engine.
-   Implementing and operating an infrastructure based on containers (Docker) deployed on Google Cloud. Design the infrastructure to be portable to the client's private cloud.
-   Automating the build, testing, and deployment of the different apps using GoCD as a continuous delivery tool and Docker container images as build artifacts.
