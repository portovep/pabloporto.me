I was assigned to bootstrap a new team to evolve a back-office application that manages sales agent accounts for a company in the green energy space. I was also responsible for providing advice to the infrastructure team. Some tasks:

-   Provide technical input in the discovery phase of the new features for the platform.
-   Help the team understand the system's architecture based on several PHP services built with different frameworks.
-   Help the team to start working on a frontend application built with Vue/Nuxt.
-   Advice the client's infrastructure team on best practices around observability and infrastructure as code.
-   Create a proposal on how the client could scale their infrastructure platform to reduce toil and make developers more effective.
-   Design and implement a proof of concept based on Zipkin to assess the best way to implement distributed tracing across the different microservices.
