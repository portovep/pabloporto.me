I worked as a lead consultant within a team in charge of assessing and suggesting a target architecture for one of Thoughtworks clients. Some of the tasks I helped with:

-   Analyse current as-is data architecture by interviewing the client's data engineers and leaders, gathering information about current pain points in the architecture.
-   Facilitate workshops with stakeholders to brainstorm potential solutions.
-   Design and propose to-be data architecture to address found pain points and scalability issues.
-   Showcase the assessment results to the client's stakeholders.
