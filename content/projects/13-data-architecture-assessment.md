I worked as a lead consultant within a team in charge of assessing the current data architecture for one of Thoughtworks clients. Some of the tasks I helped with:

-   Analyse current as-is data architecture.
-   Interview the client's data engineers and data leaders to gather information about current pain points in the architecture.
-   Facilitate workshops to brainstorm possible solutions.
-   Propose to-be data architecture that will address current pain points and scalability issues.
-   Showcase the assessment results to the client's stakeholders.
