I was assigned as a fullstack engineer to help to evolve a loans assessment platform for the government. In my role, I contributed to bringing the platform into production by:

-   Leading the design and implementation of a SPA application using React/Redux/ES6.
-   Leading the effort to introduce a shared design system and react component library to enable the different teams to deliver UI functionality faster and consistently.
-   Extending the functionality of Clojure and Java microservices to support new types of products/loans.
-   Introducing pipelines as code to enable different teams to create new microservices faster.
-   Implementing different asynchronous integration patterns between microservices using RabbitMQ.
-   Acting as an internal tech lead for one of the teams and helping the team adopting TDD, pair programming, continuous delivery, and continuous feedback practices.
