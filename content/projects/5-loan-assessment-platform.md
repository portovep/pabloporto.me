I worked as a full-stack engineer to help to evolve a loans assessment platform for the government. In my role, I contributed to bringing the platform into production by:

-   Leading the migration of a SPA to React / Redux / ES6 across several squads.
-   Coaching and training colleagues in ES6 and functional programming.
-   Leading the effort to introduce a shared design system and react component library to enable the different teams to deliver UI functionality faster and consistently.
-   Working across squads to set standards and best practices to scale the frontend codebase.
-   Extending the functionality of Clojure and Java microservices to support new types of products/loans.
-   Introducing pipelines as code to enable different teams to create new microservices from templates faster.
-   Implementing event-driven integration patterns between microservices using RabbitMQ.
-   Acting as an internal-facing tech lead for one of the teams and helping the team adopt TDD, pair programming, continuous delivery, and feedback practices.
