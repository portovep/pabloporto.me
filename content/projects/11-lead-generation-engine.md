I worked as technical lead for a small team developing a lead generation engine for one of the leading platforms in the real estate market. Some of the tasks I performed:

- Bringing a solid software engineering mindset and practices to the team.
- Evolve the architecture of the system and design an integration strategy with the company's CMS.
- Work with the head of engineering to contribute to company-wide technical initiatives.
- Help the team improve and modernize the architecture of the frontend application built with React/Redux.
- Work closely with the product owner to align the technical solution with the different initiatives to meet the cycle OKRs.
