I was assigned as a full stack developer to deliver a custom mobile web application for a big wholesale retailer. The system, build with a React/Redux stack for the front-end and Spring/Java/Cassandra for the back-end, helps drivers with the process of delivering goods to customers. Other tasks:

*   Work closely with the client to define the user experience of the MVP.
*   Implement a mobile-first and responsive UI for the MVP using HTML5 and SASS.
*   Creating and managing an infrastructure based on containers (Docker) on Google Cloud. Design the infrastructure to be portable to the client's private cloud.
*   Lead, plan and automate the deployment of the whole system into a Kubernetes cluster using Google Container Engine.
*   Automating the build, testing, and deployment of the different apps using GoCD as a continuous delivery tool and Docker container images as build artifacts.
