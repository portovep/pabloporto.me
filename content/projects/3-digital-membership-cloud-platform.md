I worked as an infrastructure engineer to help reduce the gap and bring together the development and platform teams within a program to re-platform and rebuild a digital membership service for a big company in the retail industry.
In my role, I contributed to bringing the platform into production by:

-   Helping with the design and implementation of a continuous delivery pipeline using Jenkins.
-   Advising and helping the development teams to build self-deployable microservices. Decoupling the apps (Dropwizard) from the platform.
-   Building a robust and scalable platform on AWS using EC2, S3, CloudFront, RDS, KMS, IAM, ElastiCache, CloudTrail, and other AWS services.
-   Helping teams implement infrastructure as code and continuous delivery of infrastructure changes using Terraform, Puppet, Packer, and Jenkins.
-   Advocating for the usage of Terraform modules and clean code.
-   Improving the deployment of microservices by replacing an unreliable deployment process with AWS CodeDeploy.
-   Enabling zero down-time deployments and autoscaling of the different services.
-   Advocating for DevOps principles and practices across product and platform teams.
