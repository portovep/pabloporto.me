I worked as a technical lead to help one of the biggest airlines in the world to deliver an MVP and build a startup out of it. The project involved the discovery and development of a B2B platform powered by a flight search engine that allows airlines to buy and sell cargo space. Some of the tasks:

-   Lead and facilitate workshops with both business and the technical team to foster alignment.
-   Lead the implementation and design of an MVP for 500 users from different airlines.
-   Design and implement data integration strategies with external airline IT systems. Build an ETL pipeline for ingesting airline data using AWS Lambda, S3, and Amazon MQ.
-   Design and build a search engine using graph database technologies (Neo4J).
-   Be responsible for the information security practices of the team and promote good techniques like DevSecOps and threat modeling exercises.
-   Shape the technical vision while assessing and highlighting technical risks.
-   Help the team mantaing the software quality while being pragmatic to deliver an MVP.
-   Collaborate with product owner and designer to shape the product vision and manage stakeholder and founder expectations.
-   Coach and mentor team members to foster their growth.
