I served as an engineering manager and technical advisor within a cross-functional team focused on improving software delivery performance and operational excellence for a major healthcare organization.

Our initiatives were aimed at increasing engineering efficiency, enhancing code quality, and accelerating time-to-value across multiple product teams. Some of the key contributions I made include:

-   Led cross-team assessments and optimized team topologies, enhancing team autonomy, reducing silos, and increasing delivery throughput.
-   Established baseline metrics for code maintainability and introduced automated quality gates (linters, formatters, SonarQube), reducing code smells and duplications by 40%.
-   Designed and implemented an enablement framework that accelerated onboarding and improved engineering consistency across 3+ teams.
-   Designed and implemented an MVP for an internal metrics platform, providing real-time visibility into engineering performance and technical debt for better decision-making.
-   Advised system architects and technical leads on scalable design patterns and tooling improvements, directly contributing to a boost in delivery velocity.
-   Built and deployed a custom software engineering metrics tool, enabling real-time insights into team performance and technical debt trends.
